# Welcome to my chess application.

To try it out clone the repository and use

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This application did start out as a hackathon project in which my group was building the graphic interface and i build the logic of the basic moves.
I continued working on it, implementing advanced rules and ui improvements.

As part of the further learning process in the dci course i converted the javascript into the object-syntax and integrated the vanilla-js and html into a react framework.
